Question is: give the propositional logic formula "{{ formula }}", does a group of truth assignment that make this  formula satisfiable exist? If exists, answer should only provide a list of truth value assignments in the format "variable=value", the variable should be in lower case like "p", and the value should in Capitalize first letter like "T" or "F", separated by commas and a space. So answer output should only be truth assignment. You need to make sure that all of atoms in the formula should be defined in the truth assignment. Here are some example as following: give example1: for formula "p & q", its truth assignment is:"p=T, q=T". Give example 2: for formula "! p & p", answer is"The formula cannot be satisfied". Give example 3: for formula "p | !p", its truth assignment"p=T". Give example 4: for formula "(p | q)->r", its truth assignment is :"p=T, q=T, r=T". Give example 4: for formula "!(!p | q)& ! r", its truth assignment is:"p=T, q=F, r=T".  Give example 5: for formula "!(!p ) | (q& ! r)", its truth assignment is:"p=T, q=T, r=T". Give example 6: for formula "!(p & q& ! r)", its truth assignment is :"p=T, q=T, r=T". Give example 7: for formula "!p -> (q& ! r)", its truth assignment is :"p=T, q=T, r=T". Give example 8: for formula "(!p & ! r) -> (q& ! r)", its truth assignment is :"p=T, q=T, r=T" . Give example 9: for formula "!p-> (s& ! t)", its truth assignment is:"p=T, s=T, t=T". Give example 10: for formula "p | (s& ! t)", its truth assignment is:"p=T, s=T, t=T". Give example 11: for formula "p-> (s& t)", its truth assignment is:"p=T, s=T, t=T". Give example 12: for formula "(q|r)-> (s& ! t)", its truth assignment is:"p=F, q=F, s=F, t=F". Give example 13: for formula "(r|!t)-> (s& ! t)", its truth assignment is:"r=F, s=T, t=T". Give example 14: for formula "!p &!(s& ! t)", its truth assignment is:"p=F, s=T, t=T". Give example 15: for formula " (s& ! t)->!p", its truth assignment is:"p=T, s=T, t=T". Give example 16: for formula "((!p)|s)|r", its truth assignment is:"p=T, s=T, r=T". Give example 17: for formula "((!p&q)&r) &(s& ! t)", answer is"The formula cannot be satisfied". Give example 18: for formula "((!p|q)|r)| (s& ! t)", its truth assignment is:"p=T, q=T, r= T, s=T, t=T". Give example 19: for formula "(p->q)->(r-> (s& ! t))", its truth assignment is:"p=F, q=F, r= F, s=F, t=F".
