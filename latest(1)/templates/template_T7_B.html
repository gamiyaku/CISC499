{% for formula in formulas %}
Question is: give the propositional logic formula "{{ formula }}", does a group of truth assignment that make this  formula satisfiable exist? If exists, answer should only provide just one group of truth value assignments in the format "variable=value", the variable should be in lower case like "p", and the value should in Capitalize first letter like "T" or "F", separated by commas and a space. So answer output should only be truth assignment. You need to make sure that all of atoms in the formula should be defined in the truth assignment. Here are some example as following: give example1: for formula "p & q", its truth assignment is:"p=T, q=T". Give example 2: for formula "! p & p", answer is"The formula cannot be satisfied". Give example 3: for formula "p | !p", its truth assignment"p=T".
