Question 1: Give the example: for formula "p & !p", it is not satisfiable since there doesn't exist any groups of truth assignment to make the formula True. Question is: is the propositional logic formula "((((~(~p)) | (~(r & q))) & (~((t | q) <-> (s | r)))) | (~((~(s -> r)) <-> ((s <-> s) -> (~q)))))" satisfiable?
Answer: To determine if the propositional logic formula is satisfiable, we can use a truth table to exhaustively check all possible truth assignments for the variables p, q, r, s, and t.

There are 2^5 = 32 possible truth assignments for the 5 variables. By evaluating the formula for each of these assignments, we can determine if there exists any assignment that makes the formula True.

After evaluating the formula for all possible truth assignments, if we find at least one assignment that makes the formula True, then the formula is satisfiable. If there is no assignment that makes the formula True, then the formula is unsatisfiable.

Since it is not practical to provide a truth table for 32 possible truth assignments here, you can use a truth table generator or propositional logic solver to evaluate the formula and determine if it is satisfiable.

Question 2: Give the example: for formula "p & !p", it is not satisfiable since there doesn't exist any groups of truth assignment to make the formula True. Question is: is the propositional logic formula "(p & p)" satisfiable?
Answer: Yes, the propositional logic formula "(p & p)" is satisfiable. This formula can be satisfied by assigning the truth value True to the propositional variable p. In this case, the formula evaluates to True.

Question 3: Give the example: for formula "p & !p", it is not satisfiable since there doesn't exist any groups of truth assignment to make the formula True. Question is: is the propositional logic formula "((~((((((~t) & (~r)) & ((s -> s) & (t <-> p))) | (((q & p) <-> (t <-> s)) | ((~q) | (~q)))) & ((((t & q) & (q <-> p)) & ((~q) -> (~t))) -> (((~s) | (p | p)) | ((p -> r) -> (s & p))))) | ((~(((q <-> t) & (r <-> p)) | ((p -> q) | (p <-> q)))) | (~(((t & r) | (t <-> r)) & (~(p <-> s))))))) | (~(~(((((r | s) & (q -> t)) & ((~t) -> (q | s))) <-> (((~p) -> (r <-> t)) & ((s -> q) <-> (q <-> q)))) | ((((q <-> s) -> (s <-> p)) & ((t & r) -> (p & r))) | ((~(q | s)) -> ((s -> q) <-> (t | p))))))))" satisfiable?
Answer: To determine if the propositional logic formula is satisfiable, we can use a truth table to check all possible truth assignments for the variables involved.

However, due to the complexity of the formula provided, it is not practical to manually create a truth table for it. In general, determining satisfiability for complex propositional logic formulas can be computationally and time-intensive.

For this specific formula provided, the best approach would be to use a computer program or tool that can handle and evaluate complex logical expressions to determine if it is satisfiable.

Question 4: Give the example: for formula "p & !p", it is not satisfiable since there doesn't exist any groups of truth assignment to make the formula True. Question is: is the propositional logic formula "((((~(~((((r <-> t) | (r & p)) -> ((~q) & (r | t))) & (((t <-> t) <-> (~s)) | ((q -> r) -> (s <-> t)))))) | (((((~(s <-> p)) | ((~t) & (s & s))) & ((~(t <-> p)) & ((s <-> p) | (s -> s)))) | ((((q <-> t) <-> (t <-> q)) & ((~t) & (q & p))) <-> (~((~t) & (p & s))))) -> (((((p <-> p) | (~t)) | (~(~t))) | (((q & q) & (t | s)) & ((r <-> p) <-> (q -> r)))) <-> (((~(r -> p)) <-> ((~r) <-> (r | p))) <-> (~(~(p <-> q))))))) -> (((((((s <-> q) <-> (r <-> t)) <-> ((s | r) & (s -> t))) <-> (((r -> q) -> (t | s)) <-> ((~r) & (t -> p)))) & ((((t -> p) | (~s)) & ((p | r) | (r & t))) -> (((p | q) & (~r)) | ((p | r) | (q & p))))) & ((((~(r & s)) | ((p | p) -> (r -> s))) & (~((t & p) & (s & t)))) -> ((~((s | s) | (~s))) & (((p | s) & (~t)) | ((q & s) | (r <-> s)))))) <-> (((~(((~s) <-> (p -> t)) <-> ((s | q) <-> (s | s)))) | ((((t & r) <-> (s | q)) -> ((t | p) -> (~s))) <-> (((t <-> s) <-> (s <-> t)) -> (~(q | t))))) | ((~(((~p) | (p <-> t)) <-> ((~p) <-> (q & s)))) -> ((((~s) <-> (t <-> t)) <-> ((p <-> r) | (p & s))) <-> (((s & q) & (~r)) | (~(s -> r)))))))) & (((((((~(q & q)) | ((q & s) <-> (s & q))) <-> (((q -> t) | (~t)) -> ((p | r) | (r -> s)))) & (~(((t <-> r) & (~s)) & ((q | t) -> (~r))))) -> (~((((~q) <-> (t & s)) <-> (~(q | p))) <-> (~((~p) | (q | t)))))) & (((~(~((t | q) | (p & t)))) | ((((p | s) & (q & r)) <-> ((q & p) <-> (~r))) -> (~((p | s) -> (r & p))))) -> (((~((s | r) | (r | t))) | (((p -> s) <-> (q | t)) <-> ((q & q) | (s <-> s)))) & ((((p <-> q) | (s | s)) <-> (~(r <-> r))) <-> (((q -> q) | (q <-> t)) & ((~t) -> (p <-> r))))))) -> ((((((~(p | p)) <-> ((t <-> s) -> (s -> p))) & (((s & p) <-> (q -> s)) & ((q | p) | (t <-> q)))) -> ((((~t) -> (p | t)) | ((r -> r) & (s <-> s))) -> ((~(r & t)) -> ((t | q) <-> (s <-> r))))) <-> (((((p -> q) -> (~q)) | ((~t) & (t | p))) -> (~(~(r & p)))) | (((~(s <-> t)) | ((q & q) | (s | s))) -> (((t | t) | (~p)) <-> ((r <-> q) <-> (p <-> p)))))) <-> (~(((((s -> q) | (t <-> t)) & ((t & t) <-> (s <-> s))) <-> (((r <-> q) | (t | s)) | ((~t) <-> (p | r)))) <-> ((((t <-> t) -> (q | r)) <-> (~(s -> s))) & (((~q) & (~r)) -> (~(t | s)))))))))" satisfiable?
Answer: We need to check if there exists any groups of truth assignment that make the formula True. As the formula is quite complex, it's not easy to determine satisfiability manually.

We can use a SAT solver to determine whether the propositional logic formula is satisfiable or not. A SAT solver is a computer program that can determine the satisfiability of a given propositional logic formula.

We input the formula into a SAT solver and let it determine whether the formula is satisfiable or not. SAT solvers are efficient in solving such complex propositional logic formulas and can provide a quick answer to the question of satisfiability.

Question 5: Give the example: for formula "p & !p", it is not satisfiable since there doesn't exist any groups of truth assignment to make the formula True. Question is: is the propositional logic formula "((((~((~(~((t & s) | (s | q)))) <-> (~(~((~t) & (~q)))))) -> (((~(((t <-> t) & (s <-> t)) -> ((q <-> p) | (~q)))) & ((((s <-> p) -> (q | q)) | ((q <-> t) | (~t))) & (~((t & q) & (~p))))) | ((((~(t -> q)) <-> ((s -> q) <-> (q -> s))) -> (((p <-> t) <-> (t -> p)) -> ((t -> q) | (r -> s)))) | ((((s & t) <-> (q | p)) -> ((s -> r) <-> (t -> t))) | (((p | s) <-> (~p)) <-> ((p <-> p) <-> (r & p))))))) -> (((((~((t <-> r) -> (~s))) & (((t | r) <-> (t & s)) | ((~t) <-> (r <-> p)))) | ((~((p & q) & (p -> q))) | (((p & r) -> (p | p)) <-> ((q -> q) | (s -> s))))) <-> ((((~(r & p)) | ((t <-> t) & (r -> t))) <-> (((r & t) <-> (s <-> s)) <-> ((~r) -> (p <-> q)))) | (((~(t <-> p)) -> ((t <-> s) <-> (q <-> t))) & (((r | q) & (~r)) & ((t & s) | (s <-> p)))))) & ((((~((s & s) | (~t))) | ((~(r & r)) | ((t -> s) <-> (p -> p)))) <-> ((((r & p) & (p & t)) & ((~t) <-> (r -> q))) | (((~t) | (s | r)) | ((s -> s) -> (r | t))))) -> ((((~(~r)) & ((p -> t) & (q <-> r))) & (~((~q) | (r -> p)))) & (~((~(~s)) | (~(t -> r)))))))) <-> ((~((~((((t <-> q) -> (t -> q)) -> ((~t) & (p | t))) <-> (((r & s) -> (~r)) <-> ((s & p) | (~p))))) & (((((~s) <-> (~r)) | (~(t -> s))) <-> (((~p) -> (~p)) & ((t | r) | (q | p)))) | (~(((r & q) -> (s | p)) | ((t & s) <-> (~q))))))) & (((((((~q) <-> (t -> q)) | ((s & s) & (q & r))) | (((~r) <-> (p <-> r)) | ((p <-> p) & (s | p)))) -> (((~(r -> s)) <-> ((~p) <-> (p & q))) -> ((~(~r)) -> (~(p & p))))) & (((~((s <-> q) -> (r | r))) | (((q -> r) <-> (t -> p)) | ((s & r) | (t <-> p)))) -> (((~(s <-> s)) <-> ((q & r) -> (~s))) <-> (((t & s) -> (~t)) & ((t | q) -> (t & s)))))) | (((~(((s <-> q) -> (~s)) | ((r & q) -> (~t)))) <-> (~(((s | p) -> (r | q)) <-> ((q | t) <-> (~t))))) -> (((((q <-> t) <-> (~t)) -> (~(p | t))) & (((t -> s) | (q <-> s)) | ((p -> q) <-> (q & r)))) & ((((q <-> t) | (~p)) <-> ((r | s) <-> (r <-> p))) | (((t | t) -> (s & t)) <-> ((r | q) <-> (q <-> r)))))))))" satisfiable?
Answer: To determine if the propositional logic formula is satisfiable or not, we would need to evaluate all possible truth assignments for its variables. This would involve constructing a truth table with all possible combinations of truth values for the variables involved in the formula. By evaluating each subformula step by step according to the rules of propositional logic, we would be able to determine if the entire formula can be made True for at least one truth assignment.

Due to the complexity of the formula provided, it would be impractical to do this manually. It is recommended to use a computer-based tool such as a SAT solver to determine the satisfiability of such a complex logical formula. SAT solvers are programs designed to efficiently solve satisfiability problems in propositional logic.

Question 6: Give the example: for formula "p & !p", it is not satisfiable since there doesn't exist any groups of truth assignment to make the formula True. Question is: is the propositional logic formula "(t & s)" satisfiable?
Answer: Yes, the propositional logic formula "(t & s)" is satisfiable. It can be satisfied when both t and s are assigned the truth value True.

Question 7: Give the example: for formula "p & !p", it is not satisfiable since there doesn't exist any groups of truth assignment to make the formula True. Question is: is the propositional logic formula "((~(((~(((q | s) <-> (q | r)) <-> ((~p) <-> (s -> t)))) & ((((s | r) -> (~s)) | ((t & q) <-> (s & r))) & (((r -> p) | (~r)) <-> ((r -> t) & (t | r))))) & (((((q & t) <-> (s & p)) <-> (~(q <-> s))) -> (((p <-> t) -> (~p)) | ((q & t) -> (t & r)))) & (((~(p <-> p)) & ((s -> t) & (s -> t))) -> (~(~(s -> p))))))) | ((~((((~(~r)) -> ((s & q) | (r -> t))) <-> (((s | q) | (q | s)) <-> ((r & t) | (r -> r)))) <-> ((((t | t) -> (t -> r)) <-> ((s <-> p) & (~s))) & (~((r -> s) & (s -> q)))))) -> (~(((((r <-> t) <-> (~p)) <-> ((~r) -> (~t))) | (((~s) <-> (p <-> p)) | ((r <-> s) & (r & q)))) | (((~(~r)) | ((s <-> r) | (q & p))) -> (((q <-> t) | (~t)) | ((t -> q) <-> (r -> p))))))))" satisfiable?
Answer: To determine if the propositional logic formula is satisfiable, we would need to check if there exists any set of truth assignments to the variables (p, q, r, s, t) that make the entire formula True.

This process can be quite complex and time-consuming due to the size of the formula. One approach is to use a truth table generator to systematically test all possible truth assignments to the variables and check if the formula evaluates to True for any of them.

Alternatively, one can use a computer program or software tool that is capable of performing satisfiability checking for complex propositional logic formulas.

Without performing the actual computations, it is not possible to definitively determine if the formula is satisfiable or not.

Question 8: Give the example: for formula "p & !p", it is not satisfiable since there doesn't exist any groups of truth assignment to make the formula True. Question is: is the propositional logic formula "(((~t) & (t | t)) <-> ((q | s) | (~p)))" satisfiable?
Answer: Let's analyze the formula step by step:

1. (~(t) & (t | t)) simplifies to (F & t) which is always False.
2. (q | s) | (~p) simplifies to (q | s) | (~p) which would depend on the values of q, s, and p.

Therefore, the entire formula simplifies to False, since the first part is always False. Since there is no truth assignment that would make the formula True, the propositional logic formula "(((~t) & (t | t)) <-> ((q | s) | (~p)))" is not satisfiable.

Question 9: Give the example: for formula "p & !p", it is not satisfiable since there doesn't exist any groups of truth assignment to make the formula True. Question is: is the propositional logic formula "((~(~((~(s | q)) | ((p <-> p) & (~t))))) <-> (((((s <-> t) & (p <-> q)) & ((~r) -> (r -> s))) | ((~(~t)) | ((r <-> q) <-> (~p)))) | (~((~(r | t)) | (~(~r))))))" satisfiable?
Answer: To determine if the propositional logic formula is satisfiable, we can use a truth table to evaluate all possible truth assignments for the variables s, q, p, t, and r. This formula is quite complex, so it may be easier to use a truth table generator to check if there exists any combination of truth values for the variables that make the entire formula True. 

If you input the formula into a truth table generator and find that there is at least one combination of truth values for the variables that makes the formula True, then the formula is satisfiable. If there is no combination of truth values that makes the formula True, then the formula is not satisfiable.

Question 10: Give the example: for formula "p & !p", it is not satisfiable since there doesn't exist any groups of truth assignment to make the formula True. Question is: is the propositional logic formula "((((((r | p) | (~q)) | ((r & t) <-> (r & r))) & ((~(t -> s)) & ((s | p) -> (q <-> r)))) <-> ((~((s | s) & (~r))) & ((~(t | t)) & ((~t) | (q -> p))))) & ((~((~(r <-> r)) <-> ((r <-> r) & (p <-> r)))) <-> ((((r | p) <-> (t -> r)) -> ((~p) <-> (~t))) -> (((p -> q) | (q <-> p)) <-> ((q | t) | (p -> t))))))" satisfiable?
Answer: To determine whether the propositional logic formula is satisfiable, we need to check if there exists a truth assignment that makes the whole formula True. However, given the complexity of the formula, it is not practical to manually compute all possible truth assignments.

One way to check the satisfiability of a complex propositional logic formula is to use a SAT solver, which is a computer program that can determine whether a given Boolean formula is satisfiable.

Without using a SAT solver, it is difficult to determine the satisfiability of this specific propositional logic formula manually due to its complexity.
