Question is: give the propositional logic formula "((((!q) & (p <-> s)) -> ((p | p) | (r | q))) -> (((q -> p) & (!t)) & ((!p) & (t <-> q))))", does a group of truth assignment exist? If exists, answer should only provide a list of truth value assignments in the format "variable=value", separated by commas and a space. So answer output should only be truth assignment.
Answer: There is no truth assignment that makes the formula True.
