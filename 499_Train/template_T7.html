{% for formula in formulas %}
Give example1: for formula "p & q", it is satisfiable since there exists at least a group of truth assignment:"p=T, q=T" to make the formula True. Give example 2: for formula "p & p", it is not satisfiable since there is no truth assignment for formula and there is no truth assignment. Give example 3: for formula "p | !p", it is satisfiable since there exists at least a group of truth assignment:"p=T" to make the formula True. Give example 4: for formula "(p | q)->r", it is satisfiable since there exists at least a group of truth assignment:"p=T, q=T, r=T" to make the formula True. Give example 4: for formula "(p | q)<->(r & !q)", it is satisfiable since there exists at least a group of truth assignment:"p=T, q=F, r=T" to make the formula True. Give example 5: for formula "(p | q)& !q", it is satisfiable since there exists at least a group of truth assignment:"p=T, q=F, r=T" to make the formula True. Give example 5: for formula "!(!p | q)& ! r", it is satisfiable since there exists at least a group of truth assignment:"p=T, q=F, r=T" to make the formula True.  Give example 6: for formula "!(!p ) | (q& ! r)", it is satisfiable since there exists at least a group of truth assignment:"p=T, q=T, r=T" to make the formula True. Give example 7: for formula "!(p & q& ! r)", it is satisfiable since there exists at least a group of truth assignment:"p=T, q=T, r=T" to make the formula True. Give example 8: for formula "!p <-> (q& ! r)", it is satisfiable since there exists at least a group of truth assignment:"p=T, q=T, r=T" to make the formula True. Give example 9: for formula "(!p & ! r) <-> (q& ! r)", it is satisfiable since there exists at least a group of truth assignment:"p=T, q=T, r=T" to make the formula True. Give example 10: for formula "!p-> (s& ! t)", it is satisfiable since there exists at least a group of truth assignment:"p=T, s=T, t=T" to make the formula True. Question is: give the propositional logic formula "{{ formula }}", does a group of truth assignment exist? If exists, return at least a group of example.
