{% for formula in formulas %}
You need to produce answer through specific steps. Give the example1: for formula "(p & q) | (r & !s) ". First step is, decompose the formula into two parts: (p & q) and (r & !s). Second step is, these two parts are conneccted in "or". Third step is, try to find a group of truth assignment, to make the formula True. For this formula is : "p=T, q=T, r=T, s=F ". Question is: give the propositional logic formula "{{ formula }}", does a group of truth assignment exist? If exists, return at least a group of example.
