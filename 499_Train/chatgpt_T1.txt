Question 1: Give the example: for formula "p & q", it is satisfiable since there exists at least a group of truth assignment:"p=T, q=T" to make the formula True. Question is: is the propositional logic formula "(((~((((((~s) <-> (p -> s)) | ((~q) | (s <-> r))) | (~((p | p) & (t <-> p)))) -> ((((q | r) | (r -> q)) | ((p <-> t) & (s & t))) & (((r & t) -> (r -> r)) | ((~t) & (p <-> s))))) <-> (~((((p & t) <-> (~r)) -> ((p -> r) & (q -> p))) | (((~t) -> (r & q)) & (~(p -> t))))))) -> (((((((~t) | (r | r)) | ((p | r) <-> (r -> r))) | (((t | p) | (s <-> q)) | ((p & r) -> (t & p)))) -> ((((r & t) & (r <-> r)) <-> (~(p & t))) | (((p -> p) -> (~t)) -> ((p | s) <-> (~s))))) <-> (((~(~(~p))) -> (((~t) & (~s)) | ((p <-> r) -> (~t)))) | (~(((q -> p) & (q | t)) & ((t & r) | (t -> p)))))) -> ((~((((~s) & (s -> t)) & ((q | s) & (r -> q))) -> (((t -> r) & (s <-> s)) <-> ((t | r) & (r <-> t))))) -> (((((q <-> t) | (r | q)) & (~(q -> t))) | (((q | r) -> (r & p)) & ((q & q) <-> (p -> p)))) & ((((p | q) & (r <-> q)) <-> ((p <-> s) <-> (r -> t))) -> (((s & t) -> (r | s)) <-> ((t <-> t) <-> (s | t)))))))) & ((((((((q & t) -> (~r)) & ((s -> s) | (~r))) | (((r <-> p) -> (t -> p)) <-> (~(r -> r)))) -> (~((~(p -> q)) -> (~(s <-> p))))) -> (~((~((q <-> s) <-> (q -> q))) -> (((p | t) <-> (~r)) -> ((s & p) <-> (t | q)))))) & ((((((p & s) <-> (~r)) & ((p | q) & (s & r))) & (((q <-> s) -> (q & t)) <-> ((r & s) -> (q | s)))) & ((~((r | r) & (~r))) | (((~r) | (p | p)) | ((t -> r) | (p -> q))))) <-> ((((~(r <-> t)) <-> ((q & s) <-> (~q))) | (~((p <-> p) & (s | p)))) & ((((~s) & (r & p)) & ((~p) | (t <-> q))) & (~((r -> t) & (~q))))))) -> (((((~((~s) | (s -> s))) & (~((r <-> q) | (r & t)))) | (~(((p <-> p) | (p <-> t)) <-> ((~p) <-> (s | q))))) -> (((((t <-> r) & (r -> s)) <-> ((q | s) -> (t & s))) <-> (((r | s) <-> (s -> t)) | ((r <-> q) -> (r | s)))) <-> ((((~q) | (q | r)) <-> ((s | q) <-> (s <-> t))) & (~((~p) <-> (r | r)))))) -> (~(((((~p) -> (q | q)) | ((s | r) -> (p & r))) <-> (((q | t) <-> (p <-> p)) -> ((r -> s) -> (s & p)))) -> ((~((~t) & (p <-> s))) -> (((q | q) | (s <-> r)) | ((~p) | (r <-> q)))))))))" satisfiable?
Answer: Yes, the propositional logic formula provided is satisfiable. Although it is a complex formula, there exists at least one truth assignment that would make the formula True.

Question 2: Give the example: for formula "p & q", it is satisfiable since there exists at least a group of truth assignment:"p=T, q=T" to make the formula True. Question is: is the propositional logic formula "((r <-> q) <-> (r -> p))" satisfiable?
Answer: To determine if the propositional logic formula "((r <-> q) <-> (r -> p))" is satisfiable, we need to examine all possible truth assignments for the variables r, q, and p.

Let's analyze the formula step by step:
1. r <-> q: 
- If r is true and q is true, then (r <-> q) is true.
- If r is false and q is false, then (r <-> q) is true.
- If r is true and q is false, then (r <-> q) is false.
- If r is false and q is true, then (r <-> q) is false.

2. r -> p: 
- If r is true and p is true, then (r -> p) is true.
- If r is true and p is false, then (r -> p) is false.
- If r is false, then (r -> p) is always true.

Now, we can combine the results of (r <-> q) and (r -> p) into the main formula:
- ((r <-> q) <-> (r -> p)):
If we substitute the possible truth values for r, q, and p into the formula, we can see that there is no combination of truth assignments that satisfy the entire formula.

Therefore, the propositional logic formula "((r <-> q) <-> (r -> p))" is not satisfiable.

Question 3: Give the example: for formula "p & q", it is satisfiable since there exists at least a group of truth assignment:"p=T, q=T" to make the formula True. Question is: is the propositional logic formula "(~(((((~(~(r <-> q))) & (((s -> s) <-> (~r)) & ((r & s) <-> (r <-> r)))) -> (~(((t <-> q) <-> (~p)) <-> ((r -> p) <-> (r | r))))) -> (((~((t -> q) | (r -> s))) | (((s | p) -> (~t)) <-> ((t <-> s) <-> (s | p)))) -> ((((s | s) <-> (r -> r)) <-> ((r -> p) <-> (q -> q))) <-> ((~(r <-> t)) -> ((r & p) <-> (r & r)))))) & ((~((((q <-> r) <-> (r <-> q)) | ((t <-> q) <-> (~p))) <-> (((r | p) -> (s & r)) -> ((~r) <-> (s | q))))) & (((~((~s) -> (p <-> s))) <-> (((~s) <-> (s <-> p)) | ((~q) -> (~s)))) & ((((q & q) & (t & t)) | (~(~t))) & (~((p | t) & (~q))))))))" satisfiable?
Answer: To determine if the propositional logic formula is satisfiable, we need to check if there exists a truth assignment for the propositional variables that makes the entire formula True. This involves analyzing the formula and all its nested sub-formulas to see if there is a combination of truth values that satisfy the entire formula.

In this case, the formula is extremely complex and nested, making it very difficult to determine satisfiability by hand. The best approach would be to use a computer program or truth table generator to exhaustively check all possible truth assignments for the propositional variables and see if any combination makes the entire formula True.

Therefore, without actually calculating all possible truth assignments, we cannot definitively say whether the formula is satisfiable or not.

Question 4: Give the example: for formula "p & q", it is satisfiable since there exists at least a group of truth assignment:"p=T, q=T" to make the formula True. Question is: is the propositional logic formula "(~(~(~((r <-> t) & (~t)))))" satisfiable?
Answer: To determine if the propositional logic formula "(~(~(~((r <-> t) & (~t)))))" is satisfiable, we can simplify it step by step using the negation elimination and double negation laws:

1. ~(~(~((r <-> t) & (~t))))
2. ~(~((r <-> t) & (~t))) (applying negation elimination)
3. ~((r <-> t) & (~t)) (applying double negation)
4. ~(~(r <-> t) | ~~t) (De Morgan's law)
5. ~(~(r <-> t) | t) (double negation)
6. ~(r <-> t | t) (De Morgan's law)
7. ~(r | ~t | t) (biconditional elimination)
8. ~(r | ~(t & ~t)) (associative law)
9. ~(r | ~f) (complement law)
10. ~(r | f) (double negation)

At this point, we can see that the formula became unsatisfiable because the formula evaluates to ~(r | f), which means it is not possible for both r and f to be false at the same time. Therefore, the propositional logic formula "(~(~(~((r <-> t) & (~t)))))" is not satisfiable.

Question 5: Give the example: for formula "p & q", it is satisfiable since there exists at least a group of truth assignment:"p=T, q=T" to make the formula True. Question is: is the propositional logic formula "((((((((t -> t) | (q <-> r)) | ((p | p) <-> (p -> q))) & (((q & r) -> (~p)) & ((t <-> t) & (p & q)))) | (~(((t -> r) -> (s & p)) -> ((r | p) <-> (~p))))) -> (((((r & t) | (~s)) -> ((r | r) & (~p))) & (~((~p) -> (t <-> s)))) & ((((t <-> r) | (~p)) -> ((q & q) & (~r))) | (((r | t) -> (p & r)) & ((~s) & (q -> p)))))) & ((~((((~s) -> (p & p)) | (~(s -> t))) | ((~(t <-> r)) & ((t & p) -> (p | t))))) -> (((((~p) <-> (~r)) | ((~t) -> (r <-> s))) & ((~(s & s)) & ((p <-> q) -> (~s)))) & ((~((s & s) & (r & r))) | (~((r & p) | (q -> p))))))) <-> (~(((((~(t <-> r)) & ((~p) | (s & r))) -> (((r -> r) & (~t)) & (~(r & p)))) -> ((((s & q) | (p & q)) <-> ((t -> t) | (r <-> t))) <-> (~((t & p) & (t | s))))) | (((((s <-> r) & (p & q)) -> ((p -> q) & (t | r))) | (((p <-> q) <-> (q | r)) | ((s & p) | (s & p)))) | (((~(r & t)) <-> ((~t) -> (t & s))) | (((s | q) -> (t & t)) -> (~(p -> p))))))))" satisfiable?
Answer: To check if the propositional logic formula is satisfiable, we would need to analyze it and see if there exists a truth assignment that makes the entire formula True.

Due to the complexity of the formula provided, it would require a detailed analysis and evaluation of all the sub-formulas, implications, conjunctions, and disjunctions.

It is not feasible to determine if the formula is satisfiable without actually performing the truth assignment analysis. This would involve checking all possible combinations of truth values for the variables (p, q, r, s, t) within the formula.

In general, propositional logic formulas with a large number of variables and complex expressions like the one provided can be difficult to analyze and determine satisfiability without the aid of a computer algorithm or tool.

Question 6: Give the example: for formula "p & q", it is satisfiable since there exists at least a group of truth assignment:"p=T, q=T" to make the formula True. Question is: is the propositional logic formula "(~((((~((~s) | (p | q))) -> (((t & q) & (~r)) & ((q -> r) <-> (p <-> s)))) | ((((t & s) -> (~q)) -> ((~s) <-> (t & p))) -> (~(~(p | p))))) -> (((((~t) -> (t <-> p)) <-> ((s -> t) | (s | r))) | (~((q | s) & (t <-> p)))) & ((((p -> p) <-> (p & q)) <-> ((s & s) <-> (~q))) -> (((q & q) & (t | t)) -> (~(r | s)))))))" satisfiable?
Answer: To determine if the propositional logic formula is satisfiable, you would need to check if there exists an assignment of truth values to the propositional variables (p, q, r, s, and t) that would make the entire formula True.

Analyzing such a complex formula manually can be quite challenging. One approach is to use a truth table to systematically check all possible truth value assignments to the variables and evaluate the formula. If there exists at least one assignment that makes the formula True, then the formula is satisfiable.

However, due to the complexity of the provided formula, it would be extremely time-consuming and laborious to construct a truth table. One could utilize automated theorem provers or solvers, such as SAT solvers, to efficiently determine the satisfiability of such a complex formula. These tools can systematically search for a satisfying assignment or show that no such assignment exists.

Question 7: Give the example: for formula "p & q", it is satisfiable since there exists at least a group of truth assignment:"p=T, q=T" to make the formula True. Question is: is the propositional logic formula "(~((r -> r) & (~r)))" satisfiable?
Answer: To determine if the propositional logic formula "(~((r -> r) & (~r)))" is satisfiable, we can first simplify the formula:

1. Simplify the implication "r -> r":
Since an implication "p -> q" is equivalent to "~p v q", we have "r -> r" = "~r v r" = "r v r" = "r". 

2. Substituting "r" into the original formula:
We get "((~r) & (~(~r)))", which simplifies to "((~r) & r)", which is always False.

Therefore, the propositional logic formula "(~((r -> r) & (~r)))" is not satisfiable since it results in a contradiction and cannot be made True under any truth assignment.

Question 8: Give the example: for formula "p & q", it is satisfiable since there exists at least a group of truth assignment:"p=T, q=T" to make the formula True. Question is: is the propositional logic formula "((((((((~q) <-> (t <-> r)) <-> ((q | s) | (~t))) <-> (((q <-> q) <-> (~q)) -> ((~q) -> (p <-> q)))) -> ((~((r | p) | (p -> q))) | (((p | q) | (p | p)) -> ((~r) | (t <-> s))))) -> (((((~q) & (~s)) | ((s <-> p) <-> (s <-> s))) | (((p <-> r) | (p & t)) | ((r <-> r) | (r -> t)))) & ((~((~r) <-> (t | s))) <-> (((p <-> t) -> (q <-> q)) <-> ((t & t) | (r -> r)))))) <-> ((((((t | q) <-> (r | p)) | ((s -> r) | (t & t))) <-> (~((t | t) | (q & r)))) <-> ((~((r -> q) & (p -> t))) -> ((~(~p)) -> ((~q) & (q | p))))) <-> (((((s & q) -> (t | t)) | ((q | r) & (p | p))) -> (((r | t) -> (~r)) & ((t -> p) & (~t)))) -> ((~((t & t) -> (t | r))) -> ((~(t -> t)) -> ((t -> p) & (~s))))))) -> (((((~((s & r) | (s -> p))) | (((q <-> r) <-> (p | s)) <-> ((p -> t) -> (~s)))) & (((~(p <-> t)) -> ((r & q) <-> (q -> p))) & (~((s <-> s) | (~s))))) -> ((~(((r | q) -> (p -> t)) -> ((q | t) <-> (s | s)))) | (~((~(r -> s)) <-> ((r <-> t) | (t -> r)))))) -> (((~((~(r | s)) -> ((~t) <-> (~s)))) -> (((~(t | s)) <-> ((p | s) | (r | s))) <-> (((~s) <-> (r <-> s)) | ((t <-> r) -> (t | s))))) -> (((((s | p) <-> (p & p)) <-> ((t | p) <-> (s -> p))) | ((~(r -> t)) | ((q & t) -> (q -> t)))) & ((((p <-> s) -> (s & p)) & ((s -> q) -> (~q))) | (((~p) -> (~q)) <-> (~(~q))))))))" satisfiable?
Answer: To determine if the given propositional logic formula is satisfiable, we need to check if there exists at least one truth assignment for the variables that makes the formula true.

Given the complexity of the formula provided, it would be difficult to analyze manually. We would need to use a truth table or a theorem prover to check satisfiability.

In general, a complex formula with multiple nested implications and logical connectives like the one provided may or may not be satisfiable. The satisfiability of such formulas is usually determined through automated methods rather than manual analysis.

Question 9: Give the example: for formula "p & q", it is satisfiable since there exists at least a group of truth assignment:"p=T, q=T" to make the formula True. Question is: is the propositional logic formula "(((~((((~(p -> p)) <-> ((s | r) -> (~t))) <-> (~((q & p) & (r | r)))) & ((~(~(s & q))) <-> (((t & r) -> (~p)) -> ((p & s) & (q <-> t)))))) -> (((((~(q & p)) <-> ((r -> r) <-> (q & q))) -> (((p <-> q) <-> (p <-> t)) -> ((p & t) | (r -> r)))) | ((((q <-> t) & (~p)) <-> ((q <-> r) & (q <-> t))) -> ((~(s -> q)) & ((r & s) & (q | q))))) & (((((t <-> t) -> (r <-> q)) -> ((t & p) -> (~r))) | (~(~(r -> r)))) & ((((q <-> r) | (q & t)) <-> (~(~t))) -> (((~p) | (~q)) | ((t -> q) -> (s -> q))))))) -> (((~((((s & q) <-> (s | q)) | (~(p | s))) | (((r <-> q) & (~r)) <-> ((r | s) & (s | p))))) -> (((~(~(q | p))) <-> ((~(r | p)) -> ((t -> s) <-> (p -> s)))) & ((((p & t) -> (s | t)) -> ((q -> q) <-> (p | p))) <-> (((~p) | (t -> t)) <-> (~(p & t)))))) -> (~(((((s | s) | (q -> t)) <-> ((p -> p) <-> (p & s))) <-> ((~(~s)) | ((~t) <-> (t | q)))) -> (~(((p & r) -> (t & t)) <-> ((r & r) <-> (q | p))))))))" satisfiable?
Answer: To determine if the propositional logic formula is satisfiable, we need to check if there exists a truth assignment for the propositional variables (p, q, r, s, and t) that makes the entire formula evaluate to True.

Given the complexity of the formula provided, it is not feasible to manually check all possible truth assignments. Therefore, we would need to use a propositional logic solver or truth table generator to determine if the formula is satisfiable.

Without running the formula through a solver or generating a truth table, it is not possible to definitively state whether the formula is satisfiable.

Question 10: Give the example: for formula "p & q", it is satisfiable since there exists at least a group of truth assignment:"p=T, q=T" to make the formula True. Question is: is the propositional logic formula "(~((~((q & r) -> (p <-> t))) | (((s & p) & (t -> s)) & (~(r & q)))))" satisfiable?
Answer: To determine if the propositional logic formula is satisfiable, we can use a truth table to analyze all possible truth assignments for the variables p, q, r, s, and t. 

Here is the truth table for the formula:

| p | q | r | s | t | ~((~((q & r) -> (p <-> t))) | (((s & p) & (t -> s)) & (~(r & q))) | Formula |
