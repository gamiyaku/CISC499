{% for formula in formulas %}
Give example1: for formula "p & q", answer is:"p=T, q=T". Give example 2: for formula "p & p", answer is"The formula cannot be satisfied". Give example 3: for formula "p | !p",answer is"p=T". Give example 4: for formula "(p | q)->r", answer is :"p=T, q=T, r=T" . Give example 4: for formula "(p | q)<->(r & !q)", answer is:"p=T, q=F, r=T" . Give example 5: for formula "(p | q)& !q", answer is :"p=T, q=F, r=T". Give example 6: for formula "!(!p | q)& ! r", answer is :"p=T, q=F, r=T" to make the formula True.  Give example 6 : for formula "!(!p ) | (q& ! r)", answer is :"p=T, q=T, r=T" . Give example 7: for formula "!(p & q& ! r)",answer is :"p=T, q=T, r=T" . Give example 8: for formula "!p <-> (q& ! r)", answer is :"p=T, q=T, r=T". Give example 9: for formula "(!p & ! r) <-> (q& ! r)", answer is :"p=T, q=T, r=T". Give example 10: for formula "!p-> (s& ! t)",answer is :"p=T, s=T, t=T". Question is: give the propositional logic formula "{{ formula }}", does a group of truth assignment exist? If exists, answer should only provide a list of truth value assignments in the format "variable=value", separated by commas and a space. So answer output should only be truth assignment.
