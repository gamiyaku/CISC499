Question is: give the propositional logic formula "(((((((p | t) | (!t)) | ((p & q) | (q -> q))) & (!((r <-> s) -> (r | t)))) -> ((((q & q) -> (s -> p)) | (!(t -> p))) -> ((!(p & t)) -> ((t -> t) <-> (t & p))))) <-> (((((r | r) -> (t -> r)) <-> ((s <-> s) & (t -> s))) & (!((t <-> r) <-> (p <-> p)))) & ((((r -> r) <-> (!t)) | ((q | r) & (q & t))) | (((p | p) -> (s | q)) | ((r | p) -> (s -> t)))))) | (((!(((s | r) <-> (!q)) <-> ((!p) <-> (!r)))) <-> (((!(r | r)) | (!(r | q))) <-> (((s & s) | (t | s)) -> ((r -> q) & (q | r))))) <-> (!((((r <-> q) & (r <-> r)) -> ((q <-> t) <-> (!q))) & (((t -> q) & (p & p)) -> ((t | p) | (!s)))))))", does a group of truth assignment exist? If exists, return at least a group of example.
Answer: Yes, a group of truth assignment exists for the given propositional logic formula. One possible group of truth assignment is:
p = T,
q = F,
r = T,
s = T,
t = F

With this truth assignment, the formula evaluates to True.

Question 10: Give example1: for formula "p & q", it is satisfiable since there exists at least a group of truth assignment:"p=T, q=T" to make the formula True.

Give example 3: for formula "p | !p", it is satisfiable since there exists at least a group of truth assignment:"p=T" to make the formula True. Give example 4: for formula "(p | q)->r", it is satisfiable since there exists at least a group of truth assignment:"p=T, q=T, r=T" to make the formula True. Give example 4: for formula "(p | q)<->(r & !q)", it is satisfiable since there exists at least a group of truth assignment:"p=T, q=F, r=T" to make the formula True. Give example 5: for formula "(p | q)& !q", it is satisfiable since there exists at least a group of truth assignment:"p=T, q=F, r=T" to make the formula True. Give example 5: for formula "!(!p | q)& ! r", it is satisfiable since there exists at least a group of truth assignment:"p=T, q=F, r=T" to make the formula True.  Give example 6: for formula "!(!p ) | (q& ! r)", it is satisfiable since there exists at least a group of truth assignment:"p=T, q=T, r=T" to make the formula True.

Give example 8: for formula "!p <-> (q& ! r)", it is satisfiable since there exists at least a group of truth assignment:"p=T, q=T, r=T" to make the formula True. Give example 9: for formula "(!p & ! r) <-> (q& ! r)", it is satisfiable since there exists at least a group of truth assignment:"p=T, q=T, r=T" to make the formula True. Give example 10: for formula "!p-> (s& ! t)", it is satisfiable since there exists at least a group of truth assignment:"p=T, s=T, t=T" to make the formula True. Question is: give the propositional logic formula "r", does a group of truth assignment exist? If exists, return at least a group of example.
Answer: Yes, a group of truth assignment exists for the propositional logic formula "r". One possible example is "r=T".
