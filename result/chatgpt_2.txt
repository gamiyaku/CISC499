If exists, answer should only provide a list of truth value assignments in the format "variable=value", the variable should be in lower case like "p", and the value should in Capitalize first letter like "T" or "F", separated by commas and a space. So answer output should only be truth assignment. You need to make sure that all of atoms in the formula should be defined in the truth assignment.

Question 45: Question is: give the propositional logic formula "(q | s)", does a group of truth assignment that make this  formula satisfiable exist? If exists, answer should only provide a list of truth value assignments in the format "variable=value", the variable should be in lower case like "p", and the value should in Capitalize first letter like "T" or "F", separated by commas and a space. So answer output should only be truth assignment. You need to make sure that all of atoms in the formula should be defined in the truth assignment.

Question 47: Question is: give the propositional logic formula "(q & q)", does a group of truth assignment that make this  formula satisfiable exist? If exists, answer should only provide a list of truth value assignments in the format "variable=value", the variable should be in lower case like "p", and the value should in Capitalize first letter like "T" or "F", separated by commas and a space. So answer output should only be truth assignment. You need to make sure that all of atoms in the formula should be defined in the truth assignment. 
Answer: The formula "(q & q)" is satisfied when q is true. Here is a truth assignment that satisfies the formula:

q=T.
Extracted Truth Assignment: q = T
Correct answer.

Question 48: Question is: give the propositional logic formula "(!(r -> p))", does a group of truth assignment that make this  formula satisfiable exist? If exists, answer should only provide a list of truth value assignments in the format "variable=value", the variable should be in lower case like "p", and the value should in Capitalize first letter like "T" or "F", separated by commas and a space. So answer output should only be truth assignment. You need to make sure that all of atoms in the formula should be defined in the truth assignment.
