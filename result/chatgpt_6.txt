There exists a group of truth assignments that make this formula satisfiable. One possible group of truth assignments is:
"p=T, q=T, r=T, t=F"
Extracted Truth Assignment: p = T, q = T, r = T, t = F
Incorrect answer.
Question 34: Question is: give the propositional logic formula "(t | (((q & r) -> r) | (p | r)))", does a group of truth assignment that make this  formula satisfiable exist? If exists, answer should only provide just one group of truth value assignments in the format "variable=value", the variable should be in lower case like "p", and the value should in Capitalize first letter like "T" or "F", separated by commas and a space. So answer output should only be truth assignment. You need to make sure that all of atoms in the formula should be defined in the truth assignment.

Answer: The given propositional logic formula is:
"(q & ((t | q) & ((!(p & t)) & r)))"

There exists a group of truth assignments that make this formula satisfiable. One possible group of truth assignments is:
"p=F, q=T, r=T, t=F"
Extracted Truth Assignment: p = F, q = T, r = T, t = F
Correct answer.

Question 49: Question is: give the propositional logic formula "(!((((!(!(!(p -> p)))) & p) & p) | (!(!(s & t)))))", does a group of truth assignment that make this  formula satisfiable exist? If exists, answer should only provide just one group of truth value assignments in the format "variable=value", the variable should be in lower case like "p", and the value should in Capitalize first letter like "T" or "F", separated by commas and a space. So answer output should only be truth assignment. You need to make sure that all of atoms in the formula should be defined in the truth assignment.
