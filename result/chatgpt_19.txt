Question 1: Question is: give the propositional logic formula "(((!(r -> q)) | ((s | s) & ((!((p | s) | p)) & r))) & (q | (((s | (q -> q)) | ((s | (t & r)) | (!((q | p) -> s)))) | s)))", does a group of truth assignment that make this  formula satisfiable exist? If exists, answer should only provide just one group of truth value assignments in the format "variable=value", the variable should be in lower case like "p", and the value should in Capitalize first letter like "T" or "F", separated by commas and a space. So answer output should only be truth assignment. You need to make sure that all of atoms in the formula should be defined in the truth assignment. 
Answer: The propositional logic formula you provided is quite complex. First, let's break it down. 

The given formula is:
```
(((!(r -> q)) | ((s | s) & ((!((p | s) | p)) & r))) & (q | (((s | (q -> q)) | ((s | (t & r)) | (!((q | p) -> s)))) | s)))
```

Applying logical equivalences to simplify the formula step by step:
1. Distribute `|` over `&`: `(!(r -> q) | (s | s) & (!((p | s) | p) & r)) & (q | ((s | (q -> q) | (s | (t & r) | !((q | p) -> s)) | s)))`
2. Remove tautologies `s | s` and `(q -> q)` to simplify further.

Upon simplifying the formula, it's apparent that there are multiple possibilities for satisfying the formula due to the combination of the variables involved. Let's take a valid assignment as follows:

One group of truth value assignments that make the formula satisfiable is:
```
p=F, q=F, r=T, s=T, t=T
```

If exists, answer should only provide just one group of truth value assignments in the format "variable=value", the variable should be in lower case like "p", and the value should in Capitalize first letter like "T" or "F", separated by commas and a space. So answer output should only be truth assignment. You need to make sure that all of atoms in the formula should be defined in the truth assignment. 
Answer: The propositional logic formula you provided is:

Question 22: Question is: give the propositional logic formula "((s & p) -> (((((p & q) | (q | ((!(s -> (r | s))) | r))) & s) | (!((p & p) | (((s & (q & t)) -> t) | (q -> q))))) -> r))", does a group of truth assignment that make this  formula satisfiable exist? If exists, answer should only provide just one group of truth value assignments in the format "variable=value", the variable should be in lower case like "p", and the value should in Capitalize first letter like "T" or "F", separated by commas and a space. So answer output should only be truth assignment. You need to make sure that all of atoms in the formula should be defined in the truth assignment. 
Answer: The propositional logic formula you provided contains a syntax error. Let me correct that for you:

The corrected formula is:
```
((s & p) -> (((((p & q) | (q | ((!(s -> (r | s))) | r))) & s) | (!((p & p) | (((s & (q & t)) -> t) | (q -> q)))) -> r))
