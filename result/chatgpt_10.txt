Question 32: Question is: give the propositional logic formula "((((!(q & q)) -> (q | (r | (!(q & s))))) | (p -> r)) & (!(!(t | t))))", does a group of truth assignment that make this  formula satisfiable exist? If exists, answer should only provide just one group of truth value assignments in the format "variable=value", the variable should be in lower case like "p", and the value should in Capitalize first letter like "T" or "F", separated by commas and a space. So answer output should only be truth assignment. You need to make sure that all of atoms in the formula should be defined in the truth assignment.

Answer: The propositional logic formula "(((q | q) & q) -> ((p -> p) -> (t -> ((s | (q | p)) -> p))))" is satisfiable.

One possible group of truth value assignments is:
p = T, q = T, s = T, t = T
Extracted Truth Assignment: p = T, q = T, s = T, t = T
Correct answer.
