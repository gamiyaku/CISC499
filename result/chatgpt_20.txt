Question 23: Question is: give the propositional logic formula "((!((!((!(q | t)) & ((s | (!(t -> t))) & ((!((q | (!(p -> r))) & r)) | (p & r))))) -> q)) & ((p & (t & s)) | (s & ((!((!(t & s)) -> t)) -> p))))", does a group of truth assignment that make this  formula satisfiable exist? If exists, answer should only provide just one group of truth value assignments in the format "variable=value", the variable should be in lower case like "p", and the value should in Capitalize first letter like "T" or "F", separated by commas and a space. So answer output should only be truth assignment. You need to make sure that all of atoms in the formula should be defined in the truth assignment. 
Answer: The given propositional logic formula is:

"((!((!((!(q | t)) & ((s | (!(t -> t))) & ((!((q | (!(p -> r))) & r)) | (p & r))))) -> q)) & ((p & (t & s)) | (s & ((!((!(t & s)) -> t)) -> p))))"
