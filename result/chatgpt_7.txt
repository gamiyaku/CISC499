Question 35: Question is: give the propositional logic formula "(s -> ((t | ((t & t) | (!(s -> q)))) -> p))", does a group of truth assignment that make this  formula satisfiable exist? If exists, answer should only provide a list of truth value assignments in the format "variable=value", the variable should be in lower case like "p", and the value should in Capitalize first letter like "T" or "F", separated by commas and a space. So answer output should only be truth assignment. You need to make sure that all of atoms in the formula should be defined in the truth assignment. 
Answer: For the propositional logic formula "(s -> ((t | ((t & t) | (!(s -> q)))) -> p))", a group of truth assignments that make this formula satisfiable exists. One possible truth assignment that satisfies the formula is:

s=F, t=F, q=T, p=F
Extracted Truth Assignment: s = F, t = F, q = T, p = F
Correct answer.

Question 36: Question is: give the propositional logic formula "(!((!(t | t)) | (!(!(q & (!(((!(r | q)) | t) -> s)))))))", does a group of truth assignment that make this  formula satisfiable exist? If exists, answer should only provide a list of truth value assignments in the format "variable=value", the variable should be in lower case like "p", and the value should in Capitalize first letter like "T" or "F", separated by commas and a space. So answer output should only be truth assignment. You need to make sure that all of atoms in the formula should be defined in the truth assignment.
