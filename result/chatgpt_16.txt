Question 36: Question is: give the propositional logic formula "(!((((s & p) -> t) | ((s | (!(q & (p -> s)))) -> (t | p))) -> ((!(t & (s -> p))) | ((s | r) -> (s | s)))))", does a group of truth assignment that make this  formula satisfiable exist? If exists, answer should only provide just one group of truth value assignments in the format "variable=value", the variable should be in lower case like "p", and the value should in Capitalize first letter like "T" or "F", separated by commas and a space. So answer output should only be truth assignment. You need to make sure that all of atoms in the formula should be defined in the truth assignment.
