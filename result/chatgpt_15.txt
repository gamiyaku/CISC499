If exists, answer should only provide a list of truth value assignments in the format "variable=value", the variable should be in lower case like "p", and the value should in Capitalize first letter like "T" or "F", separated by commas and a space. So answer output should only be truth assignment. You need to make sure that all of atoms in the formula should be defined in the truth assignment.

Answer: The formula is satisfiable.

Here is a group of truth assignments that satisfies the formula:
p=F, q=T, r=F, s=F, t=T.
Extracted Truth Assignment: p = F, q = T, r = F, s = F, t = T
Correct answer.

Question 44: Question is: give the propositional logic formula "((((r -> t) -> r) | ((!(!(!(p | t)))) & (!(((q -> (((s -> p) & q) & (!(!(r & s))))) -> (!(!(!(!(p -> p)))))) & q)))) | t)", does a group of truth assignment that make this  formula satisfiable exist? If exists, answer should only provide a list of truth value assignments in the format "variable=value", the variable should be in lower case like "p", and the value should in Capitalize first letter like "T" or "F", separated by commas and a space. So answer output should only be truth assignment. You need to make sure that all of atoms in the formula should be defined in the truth assignment.
