Question 2: Question is: give the propositional logic formula "((p | (!(q & (q -> (s & q))))) & (!(!(p -> (!(p & p))))))", does a group of truth assignment that make this  formula satisfiable exist? If exists, answer should only provide a list of truth value assignments in the format "variable=value", the variable should be in lower case like "p", and the value should in Capitalize first letter like "T" or "F", separated by commas and a space. So answer output should only be truth assignment. You need to make sure that all of atoms in the formula should be defined in the truth assignment. 
Answer: To determine if a group of truth assignments exists that make the given formula satisfiable:

The given formula is: 

((p | (!(q & (q -> (s & q))))) & (!(!(p -> (!(p & p)))))

We can break down the formula step by step:

1. !(q & (q -> (s & q))) simplifies to !(q & ((!q) | (s & q))) which further simplifies to !(q & (!q | (s & q))) and then to !(q & (s & q)) which simplifies to !(q & s) since q & s implies both q and s are true.

2. !(p -> (!(p & p))) simplifies to !(p -> (!p)) which simplifies to !(p -> F) which simplifies to !(F) which simplifies to T.

Therefore, the given formula simplifies to:

((p | !(q & s)) & T)

However, for the formula to be satisfiable, it means the first component ((p | !(q & s))) should be true.

This means that for the first component (p | !(q & s)) to be true, we need:

p = T, q = F, s = F

So the required truth assignment that makes the formula satisfiable is:

p=T, q=F, s=F
Extracted Truth Assignment: p = T, q = F, s = F, p = T, q = F, s = F
Incorrect answer.
Question 3: Question is: give the propositional logic formula "((((!(q & (r & (q & t)))) & r) | t) & (r & p))", does a group of truth assignment that make this  formula satisfiable exist? If exists, answer should only provide a list of truth value assignments in the format "variable=value", the variable should be in lower case like "p", and the value should in Capitalize first letter like "T" or "F", separated by commas and a space. So answer output should only be truth assignment. You need to make sure that all of atoms in the formula should be defined in the truth assignment. 
Answer: To determine if a group of truth assignments exists that make the given formula satisfiable:

The given formula is:

((((!(q & (r & (q & t)))) & r) | t) & (r & p))

Let's simplify this step by step:

1. !(q & (r & (q & t))) simplifies to !(q & (r & q & t)) which further simplifies to !(q & r & t) since r & q & t implies both q and r and t are true.

2. The first part (!(q & r & t) & r) | t will be true if either of the disjuncts is true:
   - If (!(q & r & t) & r) is false and t is true, then the whole expression will be true.

3. Therefore, we need:
   - !(q & r & t) & r = F
   - t = T
   - r & p = T

From step 3, we can see that t = T, and r & p = T. We also know that for the formula not to be true (F), !(q & r & t) & r must be false (F), so q & r & t must be true (T). This implies q = T and r = T.

Therefore, the required truth assignment that makes the formula satisfiable is:

q=T, r=T, t=T, p=T
Extracted Truth Assignment: r = F, t = T, p = T, t = T, p = T, q = T, r = T, q = T, r = T, t = T, p = T
Correct answer.

Question 4: Question is: give the propositional logic formula "((((s | r) -> s) & r) | (((q | r) -> t) | s))", does a group of truth assignment that make this  formula satisfiable exist? If exists, answer should only provide a list of truth value assignments in the format "variable=value", the variable should be in lower case like "p", and the value should in Capitalize first letter like "T" or "F", separated by commas and a space. So answer output should only be truth assignment. You need to make sure that all of atoms in the formula should be defined in the truth assignment. 
Answer: Let's simplify the given formula and check if a group of truth assignments exist that make it satisfiable:

The given formula is:

((((s | r) -> s) & r) | (((q | r) -> t) | s))

1. Simplify the implications:
- (s | r) -> s is equivalent to !s & r
- (q | r) -> t is equivalent to !t | (q | r)

2. The formula now simplifies to:
((!s & r) & r) | ((!t | (q | r)) | s) , further simplifies to 
(!s & r & r) | (!t | q | r) | s, which simplifies to 
(!s & r) | (!t | q | r) | s

3. To make the formula satisfiable, at least one of the disjuncts must be true.

Therefore, to make the formula satisfiable:
1. Either !s & r must be true
2. Or, !t | q | r must be true
3. Or, s must be true

From 1:
- s can't be false, so s must be true
- r can't be false for !s & r to be true, so r must be true

From 2:
- Since r is true, !t | q must be true
- Since q can't be false, q must be true.

Therefore, the required truth assignment that makes the formula satisfiable is:
s=T, r=T, q=T
Extracted Truth Assignment: s = T, r = T, q = T
Correct answer.

Question 5: Question is: give the propositional logic formula "(((p -> (s -> s)) -> ((s | t) & p)) & (p & r))", does a group of truth assignment that make this  formula satisfiable exist? If exists, answer should only provide a list of truth value assignments in the format "variable=value", the variable should be in lower case like "p", and the value should in Capitalize first letter like "T" or "F", separated by commas and a space. So answer output should only be truth assignment. You need to make sure that all of atoms in the formula should be defined in the truth assignment. 
Answer: Let's simplify the given formula and check if a group of truth assignments exist that make it satisfiable:

The given formula is:

(((p -> (s -> s)) -> ((s | t) & p)) & (p & r))

1. Simplify the implications:
- p -> (s -> s) is always true, as s -> s is a tautology. Thus, p can be true or false.
- (s | t) & p must be true for the formula to be satisfied.

2. The formula now simplifies to:
((T -> ((s | t) & p)) & (p & r)), which simplifies to
(((s | t) & p) & (p & r))

3. For the formula to be satisfied, the conjunction (((s | t) & p) & (p & r)) must be true.

Therefore, to make the formula satisfiable:
- The first conjunction ((s | t) & p) must be true
- The second conjunction (p & r) must be true

From the first conjunction:
- Either s or t must be true (as (s | t) must be true)
- p must be true

From the second conjunction:
- p must be true
- r can be true or false

Therefore, the required truth assignment that makes the formula satisfiable is:
p=T, s=T (or t=T), r=T (or F)
Extracted Truth Assignment: p = T, s = T, t = T, r = T
Correct answer.

Question 6: Question is: give the propositional logic formula "(((t -> (!(!(r -> s)))) -> ((t -> (!(q -> p))) | t)) | r)", does a group of truth assignment that make this  formula satisfiable exist?

So answer output should only be truth assignment. You need to make sure that all of atoms in the formula should be defined in the truth assignment. 
Answer: To determine if a group of truth assignments exists that make the given formula satisfiable:

The given formula is:

(((t -> (!(!(r -> s)))) -> ((t -> (!(q -> p))) | t)) | r)

Let's simplify this step by step:

1. Simplify the implications:
- t -> (!(!(r -> s)) simplifies to t -> (r -> s)
- t -> (!(q -> p)) simplifies to t -> (!q | p)

2. Simplify the formula:

(((t -> (r -> s)) -> ((t -> (!q | p)) | t)) | r)

(((!r | s) -> ((!q | p) | t)) | r)

((r | s | (!q | p) | t) | r)

(r | s | t)

3. To make the formula satisfiable, either r, s, or t must be true.

Therefore, the required truth assignment that makes the formula satisfiable is:

r=T (or F), s=T (or F), t=T
Extracted Truth Assignment: r = T, s = T, t = T
Correct answer.

Question 7: Question is: give the propositional logic formula "((s & s) & (((r | s) -> r) -> (!(!((!(q -> p)) | s)))))", does a group of truth assignment that make this  formula satisfiable exist?

So answer output should only be truth assignment. You need to make sure that all of atoms in the formula should be defined in the truth assignment. 
Answer: To determine if a group of truth assignments exist that make the given formula satisfiable:

The given formula is:

((s & s) & (((r | s) -> r) -> (!(!((!(q -> p)) | s)))))

Let's simplify this formula step by step:

1. The leftmost part (s & s) simplifies to s.

2. Simplify the implication inside the formula:
- (r | s) -> r simplifies to !r | r which simplifies to T.

3. Simplify the negation inside the formula:
- !(!(q -> p)) simplifies to q -> p

4. Simplify the whole formula:
- (s & ((r | s) -> T) -> (!(!((q -> p) | s))))
- (s & T -> (!(!((q -> p) | s))))
- (s & T -> (!((q -> p) | s)))
- (s & T -> !(q -> p) & !s)
- (s -> !(q -> p) & !s)
- (s -> (q & !p) & !s)
- s -> F

Since we reached a contradiction (s -> F) in the simplification, there is no truth assignment that makes the formula satisfiable.

Therefore, there is no truth assignment that makes the formula satisfiable.
Extracted Truth Assignment: 
Incorrect answer.
Question 8: Question is: give the propositional logic formula "((((t & s) -> (q & t)) | (t & t)) & (!(q & t)))", does a group of truth assignment that make this  formula satisfiable exist?

So answer output should only be truth assignment. You need to make sure that all of atoms in the formula should be defined in the truth assignment. 
Answer: Let's simplify the given formula and check if a group of truth assignments exist that make it satisfiable:

The given formula is:
((((t & s) -> (q & t)) | (t & t)) & (!(q & t))

1. Simplify the implications:
- (t & s) -> (q & t) simplifies to !(t & s) | (q & t)
- !(q & t) simplifies to !q | !t

2. Simplify the formula:
((!(t & s) | (q & t)) | (t & t)) & (!q | !t)

3. Further simplify:
( (!t | !s | q) | t) & (!q | !t)
( !t | !s | q | t) & (!q | !t)
( T | !s | q | t) & (F | !t)
( T | !s | q | t) & !t

4. For the formula to be satisfiable, the conjunction ( T | !s | q | t) & !t must be true. This happens when s=F, q=T, and t=F.

Therefore, the required truth assignment that makes the formula satisfiable is:
s=F, q=T, t=F
Extracted Truth Assignment: s = F, q = T, t = F, s = F, q = T, t = F
Correct answer.

Question 9: Question is: give the propositional logic formula "(((p -> r) -> (!(!(!(t -> (q & (p & p))))))) & (r -> s))", does a group of truth assignment that make this  formula satisfiable exist? If exists, answer should only provide a list of truth value assignments in the format "variable=value", the variable should be in lower case like "p", and the value should in Capitalize first letter like "T" or "F", separated by commas and a space. So answer output should only be truth assignment. You need to make sure that all of atoms in the formula should be defined in the truth assignment. 
Answer: To determine if a group of truth assignments exists that make the given formula satisfiable:

The given formula is:

(((p -> r) -> (!(!(!(t -> (q & (p & p))))))) & (r -> s))

Let's simplify this formula step by step:

1. Simplify the implications:
- (p -> r) simplifies to !p | r
- (!(!(!(t -> (q & (p & p))))) simplifies to ((!(!(t -> (q & (p & p))))) which further simplifies.

2. Simplify the formula:

((!p | r) -> ((!(!(t -> (q & (p & p)))))) & (r -> s))

Let's further simplify the inner implication:

- (!(!(t -> (q & (p & p)))) simplifies to !(t -> (q & (p & p)))
- !(t -> (q & (p & p))) simplifies to !(!t | (q & (p & p)))
- !t | (q & (p & p)) simplifies to !t | (q & p)

3. The formula now simplifies to:

((!p | r) -> (!t | (q & p)) & (r -> s))

4. The satisfiability relies on the conjunction of the two subformulas:

- First, for (!p | r) -> (!t | (q & p)) to be true, it should be the case that !p | r is false or !t | (q & p) is true.
- Second, for r -> s to be true, it should be the case that r is false or s is true.

Since the first subformula requires that !p | r is false, this implies that both p and r must be true. Additionally, for the second subformula to be true, r must be true for s to be true. Therefore, the required truth assignments that make the formula satisfiable are:

p=T, r=T, s=T
Extracted Truth Assignment: p = T, r = T, s = T

1. Simplify the implications:

- (p -> (!(t & r))) simplifies to !p | (t & r)
- !(t & r) simplifies to !t | !r
- ((!(t & r)) -> p) simplifies to !(!t | !r) | p

2. Simplify the formula:

((!(!p | (t & r)) | t) | ((!(!t | !r) | p) & s))
((p & !(t & r) | t) | ((t | r) | p) & s)
((p & (!t | !r) | t) | (t | r | p) & s)

So answer output should only be truth assignment. You need to make sure that all of atoms in the formula should be defined in the truth assignment.
