Answer: For the propositional logic formula "(r -> (r & (p | (!(t -> r)))))", a group of truth assignments that make this formula satisfiable does exist. Here is one possible truth assignment:

Question 28: Question is: give the propositional logic formula "((r -> ((!(!(!(s & p)))) -> p)) & r)", does a group of truth assignment that make this  formula satisfiable exist? If exists, answer should only provide a list of truth value assignments in the format "variable=value", the variable should be in lower case like "p", and the value should in Capitalize first letter like "T" or "F", separated by commas and a space. So answer output should only be truth assignment. You need to make sure that all of atoms in the formula should be defined in the truth assignment. 
Answer: For the propositional logic formula "((r -> ((!(!(!(s & p)))) -> p)) & r)", a group of truth assignments that make this formula satisfiable does exist. Here is one possible truth assignment:

r = F, s = F, p = F

Under this truth assignment:
- The subformula !(s & p) is True because both s and p are False, and the double negation is also True.
- The subformula !(!(!(s & p))) is True, which results in True -> p becoming p.
- The implication (r -> p) is True because the antecedent is False, making the entire formula True under this assignment.

Therefore, the formula is satisfiable under the given truth assignment.
Extracted Truth Assignment: r = F, s = F, p = F

Answer: For the propositional logic formula "((t & (q -> r)) | (q | p))", a group of truth assignments that make this formula satisfiable does exist. Here is one possible truth assignment:

t = F, q = F, r = T, p = T

Under this truth assignment:
- The subformula (q -> r) evaluates to True because the antecedent q is False.
- The conjunction (t & (q -> r)) simplifies to False.
- The disjunction (q | p) evaluates to True because p is True, satisfying the overall formula.

Therefore, the formula is satisfiable under the given truth assignment.

Answer: For the propositional logic formula "(s -> ((t | t) -> (p | t)))", a group of truth assignments that make this formula satisfiable does exist. Here is one possible truth assignment:

s = F, t = T, p = T

Under this truth assignment:
- The subformula (t | t) is always True.
- The implication ((t | t) -> (p | t)) is True because the antecedent is True and the consequent is True.
- The implication (s -> ((t | t) -> (p | t))) is vacuously True because the antecedent is False.

Therefore, the formula is satisfiable under the given truth assignment.
Extracted Truth Assignment: s = F, t = T, p = T
Correct answer.

So answer output should only be truth assignment. You need to make sure that all of atoms in the formula should be defined in the truth assignment. 
Answer: For the propositional logic formula "(s -> ((p -> (p | r)) | p))", a group of truth assignments that make this formula satisfiable does exist. Here is one possible truth assignment:

s = T, p = F, r = F

Under this truth assignment:
- The subformula (p -> (p | r)) is True because the antecedent p is False.
- The disjunction ((p -> (p | r)) | p) is True because p is False.
- Since the implication (s -> (...)) is vacuously True when s is True, the overall formula is satisfiable under this assignment.

Therefore, the formula is satisfiable under the given truth assignment.
Extracted Truth Assignment: s = T, p = F, r = F
Correct answer.

Question 32: Question is: give the propositional logic formula "((!((q -> s) -> (s & t))) & p)", does a group of truth assignment that make this  formula satisfiable exist?

So answer output should only be truth assignment. You need to make sure that all of atoms in the formula should be defined in the truth assignment. 
Answer: For the propositional logic formula "((!((q -> s) -> (s & t))) & p)", a group of truth assignments that make this formula satisfiable does exist. Here is one possible truth assignment:

q = F, s = F, t = F, p = F

Under this truth assignment:
- The implication (q -> s) is True because the antecedent q is False.
- The subformula ((q -> s) -> (s & t)) simplifies to True -> False, which is False.
- The negation of the outer formula is True since the implication is False.

Therefore, the formula is satisfiable under the given truth assignment.
Extracted Truth Assignment: q = F, s = F, t = F, p = F
Incorrect answer.
Question 33: Question is: give the propositional logic formula "(((t | q) & t) -> (!(q -> p)))", does a group of truth assignment that make this  formula satisfiable exist? If exists, answer should only provide a list of truth value assignments in the format "variable=value", the variable should be in lower case like "p", and the value should in Capitalize first letter like "T" or "F", separated by commas and a space. So answer output should only be truth assignment. You need to make sure that all of atoms in the formula should be defined in the truth assignment. 
Answer: For the propositional logic formula "(((t | q) & t) -> (!(q -> p)))", a group of truth assignments that make this formula satisfiable does exist. Here is one truth assignment that satisfies the formula:

t = F, q = T, p = F

Under this truth assignment:
- (t | q) evaluates to True because q is True.
- The conjunction ((t | q) & t) is False because t is False.
- The antecedent of the implication (!(q -> p)) is True since the consequent q -> p is False.
- Therefore, the implication as a whole is True.

Therefore, the formula is satisfiable under the given truth assignment.
Extracted Truth Assignment: t = F, q = T, p = F
Correct answer.

Question 34: Question is: give the propositional logic formula "(t & ((!(q -> q)) | (q & q)))", does a group of truth assignment that make this  formula satisfiable exist?
