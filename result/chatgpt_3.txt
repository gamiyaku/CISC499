If exists, answer should only provide a list of truth value assignments in the format "variable=value", the variable should be in lower case like "p", and the value should in Capitalize first letter like "T" or "F", separated by commas and a space. So answer output should only be truth assignment. You need to make sure that all of atoms in the formula should be defined in the truth assignment. 
Answer: For the propositional logic formula "(!(!(p & (q | s))))", a group of truth assignments that make the formula satisfiable exists. One possible truth assignment is as follows:

p = T, q = F, s = F
Extracted Truth Assignment: p = T, q = F, s = F
Incorrect answer.
Question 43: Question is: give the propositional logic formula "(s | (!(q & r)))", does a group of truth assignment that make this  formula satisfiable exist? If exists, answer should only provide a list of truth value assignments in the format "variable=value", the variable should be in lower case like "p", and the value should in Capitalize first letter like "T" or "F", separated by commas and a space. So answer output should only be truth assignment. You need to make sure that all of atoms in the formula should be defined in the truth assignment.
