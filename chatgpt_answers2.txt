Question 1: Is the propositional logic formula "(!p  ->  (r  | !t )  |  (t  <-> !s )  |  (!q  ->  (s  & !t )  <-> q )  |  (p  |  (r  | p )  ->  (!r  -> !q )  & !q )  -> !t )" satisfiable? If the formula is satisfiable, provide a set of atoms that make the formula true.
Answer: Yes, the propositional logic formula is satisfiable.

One set of atoms that make the formula true is:
p = true
q = true
r = false
s = false
t = false

With these values for the atoms, the formula evaluates to true.
Atom Count: 16

Question 2: Is the propositional logic formula "(!p  ->  (s  |  (q  & !q )  ->  (t  & !p )  | !r )  | !p )" satisfiable? If the formula is satisfiable, provide a set of atoms that make the formula true.
Answer: To determine if the formula is satisfiable, we need to find a set of truth values for the atoms that make the formula true. Let's analyze the formula step by step:

1. !p is true when p is false.
2. q & !q is false, as q and !q cannot both be true at the same time.
3. (s | (q & !q)) is always true because s is not dependent on the truth values of q and !q.
4. (t & !p) is true when t is true and p is false.
5. Therefore, the entire formula simplifies to (!p | !r), which is true when either p or r is false.

Therefore, the formula is satisfiable, and a set of atoms that make the formula true is:
p = false
r = false

With these truth values, the formula evaluates to true.
Atom Count: 8
